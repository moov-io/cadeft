This project uses [Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules) and Go v1.18 or newer. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/cadeft/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

### Releasing

To make a release of cadeft simply open a pull request with `CHANGELOG.md` and `version.go` updated with the next version number and details. You'll also need to push the tag (i.e. `git push origin v1.0.0`) to origin in order for CI to make the release.

### Testing

We maintain a comprehensive suite of unit tests and recommend table-driven testing when a particular function warrants several very similar test cases. After starting the services with Docker Compose run all tests with `go test ./...`. Current overall coverage can be found on [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/moov-io/cadeft/).
